        As internal combustion engines are an important part to accelerate economic growth but with the trade
        off using internal combustion engines is the pollutants emitted causing climate change and leading the 
        world to an electrical era. As internal combustion engines are still required to advance the society. So, 
        innovation have been put in place like supercharger, turbocharger, variable valve and catalytic 
        converters to improve efficiency and make internal combustion engine cleaner. Furthermore, 
        advancements in fuel development like biofuel allowing stuff like hybrid engines which can use two 
        different types of fuels depending on the requirement and the force out put required by the internal 
        combustion engine. This will limit the trade-off using internal combustion engine as much as humanly 
        possible to still use combustion engine to advance the society.

        The internal combustion engines have been a cornerstone of global development, as it has connected 
        distant lands and accelerated economic growth across continents through trade. As Internal
        combustion engines are a very important part of modern society, but lead to air quality to decline, 
        climate change and global warming to occur, so as the modern world shifts to electric era to counter 
        these trade off using combustion engine by creating electric vehicles but internal combustion engine 
        are still needed to power ships and airplanes for cargo and heavy machinery used to advance the 
        architecture and technology in today’s society. so, to counter the trade-off using Internal combustion 
        engine innovations have been made like catalytic converter, supercharging and turbocharging, variable 
        valve and lastly fuel development. what innovations have been taken to insure more refined and 
        improved internal combustion engines?

      Internal combustion engine are the main propulsion systems on the road and in the sky, which, in Mid-
      2017 Serrano mentioned, to the impossibility of replacing them as the power plant in most vehicles
      Due to the pollution caused by ICEs is mainly greenhouse gasses which contribute to climate change 
      and is the main argument against ICE. Locally emitted gaseous pollutants and noise emissions is 
      accepted as a trade-off which is unavoidable but can be limited though innovation and sophisticated 
      technology by original engine manufacturing and automotive industry, serrano 2017.To limit the trade-
      off using traditional petrol and diesel engines as low as homologation limits allow, by adopting already 
      researched and innovative technologies, like using deeper knowledge of more controlled combustion 
      process to limit the pollutants produced by ICEs. Some of the innovation technology that can be used 
      is variable valve timing as the valve’s timing of opening and closing will adjust to the different operation 
      conditions it will improve the performance output by the machine and reduce the number of pollutants 
      emitted therefore increasing the efficiency. Furthermore, power plants that use internal combustion 
      engines can improve part on the internal combustion engine to extract every drop of power from the 
      liquid oil to make the process more efficient, some of these part are Turbocharging and supercharging, 
      which dramatically increase air flow and air intake into the chamber where combustion takes place, 
      Therefore, reducing waste, as complete combustion can take place reducing the production of carbon 
      monoxide and better fuel efficiency, further reducing emission. After treatment options can be used to 
      further limit the pollutants produced. One example is the catalytic convertor, invented by a French 
      scientist Eugene Houndry in 1950, (bbc 12:53 31/10/24). Which helps to clean the exhaust gases, as 
      catalytic converters have platinum which oxidize hydrocarbons to water and the toxic gas carbon 
      monoxide to co2. Even though this was invented in 1950, catalyst chemistry research has continuously 
      improved and developed new ways to clean exhaust gases up to unexpected limits. As the design of 
      catalytic converters now include the use of metallic materiel and ceramic materials, which helps with 
      larger surface are to that the process can be carried out at a faster rate as the will be more successful 
      collisions therefore increasing the rate of reaction and limiting the emissions further, helping to 
      increase and better the air quality.

      <pre>
        Fuel development has come a long way by creating alternative fuels (like hydrogen and synthetic fuel) 
        and biofuels. Biofuels like biomethane are being used to reduce the emission of co2. Biomethane is 
        produced by decomposition of organic matter like crops, food waste, sewage and manure (Folkson, 
        Richard, Steve, 2022).as humans produce a lot of waste which can be used to convert into biofuel to 
        run internal combustion engine as various alkanolamines to remove CO2 and H2S to create biofuels 
        with biofuel being and option to be used to power internal combustion engine, this leads to hybrid 
        engines to be created which can use alternative fuels like biofuel and fossil fuel depending on the 
        requirement and the force required to be produced by the internal combustion engine. which helps with 
        the pollution and emission problem as alternative fuels can be used with in a city to reduce the direct 
        effect of pollution on human being and furthermore this will Improve the air quality.

        In conclusion, internal combustion engines have been improved to be more efficient and cleaner by 
        adopting intervention like variable valve timings to improve air flow leading to improved performance of 
        the machine. Furthermore, other technology like supercharging and turbocharging this allows improved 
        air flow to the combustion chamber allowing for complete combustion allowing for better fuel 
        efficiency and limits the pollutants produced by the internal combustion engine. Some technologies 
        are already in use like Catalytic converters which cleans exhaust gas and have been further improved 
        by using metallic and ceramic material which has a larger surface which further improves the efficiency 
        of the catalytic converter. Lastly, with biofuels being introduced and opening new opportunities like 
        hybrid engines which can use biofuel and fossil fuel to power industrial machines and on road vehicles. 
        So, in my opinion the internal combustion engine has been improved a lot to limit the trade-off using 
        them in the mordent society.
